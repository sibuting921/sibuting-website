        <p>
            I was planning to go to graduate school, but for some reason I cancelled it temporarily.
            I wanted to take this time to improve my English and to continue practicing programming,
            and I always hoped that I would have the opportunity to switch to another place of work.
            I dream to improve with people who have the same goal.

        <p>Learn</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Practice codes on LeetCode</li>
            <li>Maybe Learn SQL</li>
            <li>Learn Python</li>
            <li>Improve communication in english</li>
            <li>Maybe learn some Esperanto</li>
            <li>I heard that ai has no soul, looking for something to enrich my soul</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This is the first time I wrote a web page in code line by line.
            I found a lot of promising and talented new people posting their pages online, collecting a lot of
            interesting and new things they like.
            They inspire me and I think this site will be a great start.
