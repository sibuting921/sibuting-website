            This is my first time to write html logs from scratch myself. I found that there are many promising and
            talented
            newcomers on the web, posting their own pages on the web, with a collection of interesting and novel things,
            and
            they also have their own unique ideas. My brain is loaded with too much chaotic information to absorb and
            use
            before it fades away, and I think this site is a good place to start.
